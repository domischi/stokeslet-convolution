# Stokeslet Calculations
This is a simple module to play around with various geometries for the Stokes
equation, solved by convoluting the force field with the Green's function of
the Stokes equation, the Stokeslet. The math required for doing these
calculations can be found for example on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_flow).

Feel free to use the code to play with your systems. A good starting point for
your experimentation is probably the example.py file, which generates a simple
simulation. Please note that because this is a research code, I cannot
guarantee that any features will remain unchanged.
